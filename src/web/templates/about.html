<h1>About</h1>

<p>This experiment aims to compare and validate automated application
recommendations produced by various strategies and algorithms tunnings. Asking
real users about the relevance of the recommendation is the closest we can get
of the real accuracy of the recommender system.</p>

<p>The engine that is being tested is a free software called <a
href="http://github.com/tassia/AppRecommender">AppRecommender</a>. It was
initially developed using the Debian Project infrasctructure, but the solution
is essentially distro-independent and could even be adapted to non GNU/Linux
systems given that there was available data for that.</p>
