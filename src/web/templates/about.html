    <h1>What is this?</h1>
<p>AppRecommender is a project in development that aims to provide solutions
for application recommendation at the GNU/Linux world. It was initially thought
as a Debian package recommender, but considering the multi-distro effort in
providing platform independent solutions, it should also follow this
principle.</p>
