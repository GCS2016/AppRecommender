<h1>AppRecommender Survey</h1>
<h2>Help us learn your needs</h2>

<p>Participate in this survey and contribute for the development of
AppRecommender, a recommender system for GNU/Linux applications.</p>
<br />
<p>Please provide the list of packages installed in a real running system
(instructions above) and evaluate the list of applications suggested for it.
You need to analyse at least 10 suggestions to be considered in the survey,
though we appreciate if you do as many as you can.</p>
<br />
<p>Your help is very much appreciated!</p>
