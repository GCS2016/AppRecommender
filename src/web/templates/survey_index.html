<h1>AppRecommender Survey</h1>
<h2>Help us learn your needs</h2>

<p>Participate in this survey and contribute for the development of
AppRecommender, a recommender system for GNU/Linux applications.</p>
<br />
<p>Please provide a list of packages installed in a real running system and a
set of applications will be suggested for it. You can upload a
popularity-contest submission file (which is usually located at
'/var/log/popularity-contest') or any other file with packages name as first
field of each line. For instance, you can run the following command and upload the
generated 'packages.list' file.</p>
<p><code> # dpkg-query --show > packages.list </code></p>
<p>Given the produced recommendations you will be asked to evaluate the list of
applications suggested. You need to analyse at least 10 sugestions to be
considered in the survey, though we appreciate if you do as many as you can.</p>
<br />
<p>Your help is very much appreciated!</p>
